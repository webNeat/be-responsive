##Install

Clone this repository or download it as zip or install via bower

	bower install responsive-table

##Get Started

Include the files `responsive-table.css` and `responsive-table.js`

	<link rel="stylesheet" href="responsive-table.css">
    <script src="responsive-table.js"></script>

Then add the `be-responsive` class to any table. Be sure the table defines titles using `th` and not `td`. The `data-with-titles` could be added with value `"true"` to show titles on every row when the table is transformed ( [see the demo](http://webneat.net/jquery/responsive-table/) )
